# TODO

- [ ] LaTeX School Notes Generator: Support for courses that last a whole year
- [ ] LaTeX School Notes Generator: Get course code based on filename
- [ ] LaTeX School Notes Generator: Choosing date of a past semester
		When a previous semester is chosen, 2020W for example, it still asks if
		the first date of that semester is in 2022 (current year), 2022 01 10
		specifically. It should be on 2020 01 06.
