# What is this?

This program is meant to create the template files that you normally need. My goal is to make it as customizable as possible so you can make it your own.

# Installation

At the moment, you can only `git clone` this repository, but I an hoping to put it on Homebrew soon.

## Installing through Git

`git clone https://github.com/hussein-esmail7/template-maker`
`cd template-maker`
`./INSTALL`

If you want to run this program in Terminal just by typing the program name, you would have to add an alias in your `.bashrc` file. If you do this, you should alias to the `main.sh` file.
