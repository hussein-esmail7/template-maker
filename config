# === template-maker config file ===
# === Created by: Hussein Esmail ===

# USAGE:
# Whenever you add a variable in this file, make sure there
# isn't any spaces near the equal sign ("=").
# Example: 
#   DATE_FORMAT=$(date '+%Y %m %d')      (GOOD)
#   DATE_FORMAT = $(date '+%Y %m %d')    (BAD)

# CONFIG IN A DIFFERENT LOCATION?
# It's cool if you don't like this directory to store your config.
# All you need to do is type 'source' then the path where your desired 
# config is at. If your path has a space in it, make sure to use 
# quotations or the \ for the escape character for ' '.
# Example: source ~/.config/some/path/to/config

# DATE FORMAT
# To change the default date format, use the 'DATE_FORMAT'
# variable, and the format can be defined by seeing the 
# canonical representations by running 'man date'.
# A few representations here for an overview:
#   %c  Century (either 19 or 20) prepended to the abbreviated year.
#   %y  Year in abbreviated form (e.g., 89 for 1989, 06 for 2006).
#   %m  Numeric month, a number from 1 to 12.
#   %d  Day, a number from 1 to 31.
#   %H  Hour, a number from 0 to 23.
#   %M  Minutes, a number from 0 to 59.
#   %s  Seconds, a number from 0 to 61 (59 plus a max of 2 leap seconds).
# Default DATE_FORMAT=$(date '+%Y %m %d') 
DATE_FORMAT=$(date '+%Y %m %d') 

# USERNAME
# This variable is used for the full name of the user in author 
# sections of files. It can be a command to get it from the 
# computer, or a hard-coded string.
# Default USERNAME=$(id -F)
# If $(id -F) returns empty, it will use $(whoami)
USERNAME=$(id -F)

# DEFAULT FILENAME
# You can use this variable if you don't want your files to have the
# name 'template.whatever'
# Currently there is no way to change the format of the name if 
# 'template.whatever' already exists. If you chose 'temp_file' as the name,
# it will show 'temp_file.whatever' then 'temp_file (1).whatever' 
# then 'temp_file (1).whatever'...
# Default: TEMPLATE_NAME="template"
TEMPLATE_NAME="template"
# Ignored file types: html, css

# PROMPT_TEXT
# This variable is used when asking which file type you want to use
# Default: PROMPT_TEXT="File type: "
PROMPT_TEXT="File type: "

# REPLACE_USERNAME (COMPATIBILITY NOT ADDED YET)
# Text that is meant to replace the username that is contained in the files
# Default: REPLACE_USERNAME="[CREATOR]"
# REPLACE_USERNAME="[CREATOR]"

# REPLACE_DATE (COMPATIBILITY NOT ADDED YET)
# Text that is meant to replace the date that is contained in the files
# Default: REPLACE_DATE="[DATE]"
# REPLACE_DATE="[DATE]"

# REPLACE_FILENAME (COMPATIBILITY NOT ADDED YET)
# Text that is meant to replace the file name that is contained in the files
# Default: REPLACE_FILENAME="[FILE NAME]"
# REPLACE_FILENAME="[FILE NAME]"

# REPLACE_FILEFRONT (COMPATIBILITY NOT ADDED YET)
# Text that is meant to replace the front of the file name that is contained in the files
# Default: REPLACE_FILEFRONT="[FILE FRONT]"
# REPLACE_FILEFRONT="[FILE FRONT]"

# If you have any other template files you think can add someone else, 
# please create an 'Issue' on my Github at 
# https://github.com/hussein-esmail7/template-maker
# (Providing a sample template file will also help me)
